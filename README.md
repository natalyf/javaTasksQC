#I created the public classes and added my own solution to count how many times each loop will be executed.

Tasks from 3.2 Algorithms

# UPD.: solutions:
Task A
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
x = 21
z = 1

Task B
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
x = 280
z = 7

Task C
x = 2
z = 6
NULL loops

Task D
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
x = 0
z = 1

Task E
+1 cycle
+1 cycle
x = 18
z = 12

The tasks are following:
To determine what will display the following program item and how many times will be executed the loop  
(this code has been written in java): 

# a.
int x = 1;

int z; 

for(z = 6; z >= 2; z--)

x = x + z;

System.out.println("x = " + x);

System.out.println("z = " + z);


# b.  
int x = 7;

int z;

for(z = 1; z <= 6; z++)

x =  x+z; 

x = x * 10; 

System.out.println("x = " + x); 

System.out.println("z = " + z); 

 
# c.  
int x = 2; 

int z; 

for(z = 6; z <= 2; z++) 

x = x + z;  

System.out.println("x = " + x); 

System.out.println("z = " + z); 

 
# d.  
int x = 0; 

int z = 5; 

while (z > 1 ){ 

x = x + 1 / z; 

z = z - 1; 

  } 
System.out.println("x = " + x); 

System.out.println("z = " + z); 

 
# e.  
int x = 0; 

int z = 3; 

  do { 
  
    z = z * 2; 
    
    x = x + z; 
    
} 

while (z <7); 

System.out.println("x = " + x); 

System.out.println("z = " + z);
